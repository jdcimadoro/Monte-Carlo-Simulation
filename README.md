# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Using Monte Carlo modelling for betting

I will test various betting strategies. 
A simple strategy, a 'martingale' strategy, the d'alembert's strategy and the Labouchere's strategy. 
I use monte carlo simulator to calculate possible paths, as well as to calculate preferred variables to use including wager size and how many wagers.
